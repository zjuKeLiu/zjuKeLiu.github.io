ABSTRACT="The symmetry and geometry of a crystal fundamentally determine its various
physical and chemical properties. However, crystal structure prediction,
including space group determination and crystal structure optimization,
remains an ongoing challenge because traditional DFT-based approaches are
time- and computational-intensive even for one specific set of material,
not to mention structure prediction of massive materials. This paper
determines th e geometric structure of massive crystals solely from
chemical formulae from scratch. In addition, due to various phases or
changing environmental conditions, different pressure and temperature for
example, there could be multiple crystal structures corresponding to one
chemical formula (MS4OF), which has been overlooked or poorly addressed in
previous research. Hereby, we propose a Physics-informed Conditional
Variational Auto Encoder (PCVAE) to encode possible symmetry and geometry
distribution as well as various phases of a crystal with Gaussian
distributions. PCVAE achieves a new state-of-the-art in crystal structure
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong predictive power
of PCVAE."
